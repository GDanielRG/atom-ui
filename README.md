## Material UI

This theme converts Atom into a good looking and minimal editor without unnecessary clutter. Although it was inspired by Google's Material design, it's not completely based on the same. There are some places in which I've decided to make some decisions by my own to make the design look less haptic.

### Install

Simply go to the __Settings > Install__ section, click the "Themes" tab and search for "material-ui". After installing it, you only need to activate it within the __Settings > Themes__ section under "UI Theme".

By the way, the theme should be used with Atom's default syntax theme called "One Dark". I'm still working on a special one just for the use with this UI.

### Dock icon

If you don't like Atom's default dock icon, there are many different alternatives out there from which you can choose one that you like more.

But since there are so much that it's very hard to find the right one, I'd like to suggestion you the one I'm using: It's part of a theme called "native-ui" (which was created by [@fv0][1]) and you can download it [here][2].

This theme was inspired by Mattia Astorino's awesome [material-theme][3] for Sublime Text.
